PyFrag Plotter is a Python package developed by the TheoCheM group (https://www.theochem.nl/) for plotting data from PyFrag calculations. PyFrag is a program for performing energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and activation strain model (ASM) calculations on molecular systems.

PyFrag Plotter provides a set of functions for visualizing the results of PyFrag calculations, including orbital overlaps, populations, energies, and Voronoi Deformation Densities. The package is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to customize their plots to meet their specific needs.

Whether you are a researcher in the field of computational chemistry or a student learning about EDA and ASM calculations, PyFrag Plotter can help you visualize your data and gain insights into the electronic structure of molecular systems.
